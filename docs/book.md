# Open Source Network Management

![Open Source Network Management Cover](images/open-source-network-management.png){ align=right }

I have created a book that is all about getting started with open source tools. [Open Source Network Management](https://leanpub.com/opensourcenetworkmanagement), a book about getting started with using open source tools to manage your network environment. This book guides one along the way of _installing_, _initial configuration_, and basic ways to use the tools. All these are done with installing on a single virtual machine or on an Intel NUC system.

The book is published on [LeanPub](https://www.leanpub.com) that is a place where I can continue to make updates to the book while providing the content to the readers sooners than later. The current state of the book is at a strong technical release state. I am working through having some editing done on the book yet, but no edits of the technical components will be made.

The tools covered in the book thus far:

- [Nautobot](https://www.nautobot.com)
- [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
- [InfluxData Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/)
- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)

I encourage you to take a look, with the purchase you will be able to get the book in multiple formats including PDF, epub, and mobi formats.
