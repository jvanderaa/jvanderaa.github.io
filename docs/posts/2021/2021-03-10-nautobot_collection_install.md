This is the first post as I shift into taking a closer look at the Nautobot Ansible Collection. The collection includes many of the needed modules to effectively manage your Nautobot environment. If  This will take a deeper dive into several of the components of the **inventory plugin**, but not all of the options. The documentation for all of the collection can be found at:

- ReadTheDocs: [https://nautobot-ansible.readthedocs.io](https://nautobot-ansible.readthedocs.io)
- Galaxy Page: [https://galaxy.ansible.com/networktocode/nautobot](https://galaxy.ansible.com/networktocode/nautobot)  

This post is going to give information on how to install the collection as it may be applicable to every post in the series (as they get posted).  

If you were a user of the NetBox Ansible Collection previously, you will notice a few differences. The first big difference in the modules is that there is no preface of nautobot_ before each module. Since this Collection is developed after Ansible 2.10 they are using the FQCN (Fully Qualified Collection Name), there is no longer the need to prefix the name to the module name. So where there was a netbox_device before it will now be just device, underneath the FQCN of `networktocode.nautobot.device` as an example.  

## Installation

Installation is done via Ansible Galaxy. It is recommended to have the latest version of the collection when working on it as there are updates happening routinely. There is a **Python requirement** with many the modules of the [pynautobot](https://pynautobot.readthedocs.io) Python package.  

It does not matter which order you install these in, you just need to install both before you start using the module.

### Installation - pynautobot

To install you execute the following to get the latest version of pynautobot:

```shell
pip install pynautobot --upgrade
```

### Installation - Nautobot Collection

The collection is installed via Ansible Galaxy as a primary method to install. You can also install the collection manually from GitHub, but the galaxy method is the preferred method.

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install networktocode.nautobot
```

If you add on `--force` at the end, Ansible Galaxy will install the latest version on top of what you may already have. If you already have a version of the collection installed, Galaxy will not overwrite what you already have.

## Verification of Installation

Once you have run the steps there are many ways to verify that the installation is completed successfully for the Python package. The one that I like to use is to execute a `pip freeze | grep <package_name>`. The execution looks like this on the current date:

```shell
pip3 freeze | grep pynautobot    
pynautobot==1.0.1
```

To verify that you have installed the Nautobot Ansible Collection, you can execute the Ansible Doc command to get the current documentation. This is done as followed with the device module to verify that the docs load:

```shell
ansible-doc networktocode.nautobot.device
```

If the module is not installed properly you will see, with a key in on the first line

```shell linenums="1"
$ ansible-doc networktocode.nautobot.device
[WARNING]: module networktocode.nautobot.device not found in:
/root/.ansible/plugins/modules:/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules:/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ansible/modules
```

When the collection is installed properly you will see the following output with the command:

```
> NETWORKTOCODE.NAUTOBOT.DEVICE    (/root/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/networktocode/nautobot/plugins/modules/device.py)

## Summary

Overall the process for getting going with this collection is two steps, of installing the Python dependency and installing the collection via Ansible Galaxy. With these done, you are on your way to using the Nautobot Ansible Collection in your environment.
