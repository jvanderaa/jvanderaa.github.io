[AutoCon4](https://networkautomation.forum/autocon4) and [NautoCon@AutoCon](https://go.networktocode.com/nautocon-autocon) are in the books. It was quite the day and I have to say that this is up there on the list of my best days of the year in Network Automation. It's right there behind getting to be able to meet up with all of the Network to Code team earlier in the year. It was great to see many great friends within the Network Automation community. Hopefully we are going to be able to keep the conversation going on Slack after the event and keep the momentum going.

## Personal Highlights

So far I have been only at a few of the talks due to some unavoidable day-to-day responsibilities, but I will dive into a few of ^^my^^ highlights. If I missed out on anything here, it is not from a lack of effort by anyone, just restricted by time and priorities.

### NautoCon@AutoCon

This was the first time that the Network to Code team has put on this event that was a great collective of thoughts being put forward by organizations using [Nautobot](https://networktocode.com/nautobot/) to solve their real problems. It was a the group had a pretty awesome conversation. Rather than go into summary, I will just add a comment with the link to the time stamp once the videos are posted.

### The Hallway Track

I'm going to start with the part that was my favorite non-Nautobot part of the event, the hallway track. This was a great experience to get to say hi to so many existing friends and meeting new people. Reconnecting with several folks that I just don't get the opportunity to meet up with. And for that I say a **THANK YOU**, for just getting out and being amongst others.

On the professional angle here, it was great to meet customers of Network to Code that have entrusted us to be able to deliver on automation services and help deliver value. It is important for me professionally that I am driving the needle forward towards the goal. If I am ever getting to the point that I'm just there, that I'm not adding value, then it is time for something else. That is definitely not the case in my career at this point. Things are progressing forward.

## Presentations Attended

During the event there were multiple things going on for me that prevented me from being able to attend all of the sessions. But I was able to get to several of them. Many were good, and I want to continue driving. However, one of the themes that I'm going to be writing a bit more about in an upcoming post. There was a fair bit of CLI driven automations which is a good start. The best part is a wide range of variety of automations that are happening to many different aspects of a network. For the most part of the talks that I attended, I was able to see many portions of the full device lifecycle, however, noticeably absent in what I saw was the beginning stages, the Design and pre-deployment phases. I put the excellent talk by [Greg Botts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-botts-728310138/) of Intel at the deployment phase as it is in the time of configuring the hardware.

### Greg Botts - Overhauling Data Center Network Automation: Intel’s Data-Centric Journey

This was a fantastic talk. I'm trying to remember all of the pieces. But it is just quite a bit. But a success story about getting the data center automation in place with the right approach to the configuration of the devices. They are set up nicely for the future with having all the pieces needed to scale, or to handle break/fix replacements with ease. Once the video comes out, this is a talk you will want to prioritize.

### Cat Gurinsky - Lifecycle Automation: Troubleshooting, Upgrading & More

Cat dove into her journey with accelerating her ability to complete upgrades of data center gear. What I take away most from this was the iterative approach. This is a staple of what I see as successful Network Automation. It starts with your experiences. And then you build on it based on new experiences.

### Chris Grundemann - 2025 State of Network Automation Survey Results

The results from the 2025 State of Network Automation Survey. This one I had to duck out of a bit earlier unfortunately for me. But this is a good sign and continues to help analyze and spot the trends happening in the Network Automation community. This is a good one to review as well. It was a very good report on where we are at, and was focused on the facts.

## Summary

Overall the event is my favorite non-internal event to get to. From getting to meet up with many like minded individuals to learning what the latest trends are. This is a pretty awesome gathering of people in the Network Automation space.

What was your favorite part? Any other thoughts?
