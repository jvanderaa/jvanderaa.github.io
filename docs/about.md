I'm a veteran Network Engineer who has finally caught on how to put together CS teachings with a Networking degree. Working on doing almost all things via automation.

Self re-taught network/automation engineer. I've primarily been digging around within Ansible and Python. I've been doing Python networking since 2015 when a speaker came in and talked about how he had put together a NOC for a conference heavily leveraging automation capabilities via Python. Since then I have been going deep down the rabbit hole that is Network Automation.

In 2020 Cisco released the Cisco DevNet certification program. I am one of the first 500 individuals to achieve a Cisco DevNet certification, with passing first the DevNet Associate exam. Later I followed up that certification with the DevNet Professional certification as well.

## My Work

### Books

During the pandemic, I thought what better way to get started than with writing a book about getting started with open source network tools. Get it on [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/opensourcenetworkmanagement/). See the [Open Source Network Management tab](book.md) for more.

2024 brought the release of two more books, published by Packt. The first released book [Network Automation with Nautobot](nautobot_book.md) introduces how to automate networks with the use of Nautobot. See the tab linked for more. 

The second book in 2024 is Modern Network Observability, which provides a hands-on approach to using open source tools for network observability in 2024.

## Speaking Engagements

[timeline right(./docs/speaking_engagements.yml)]

### Ansible Content

In 2019 I worked to develop a Network Automation Course with Ansible for Packet Pushers. This was in my transition time to Network to Code. Note that the course was developed at a time when only NetBox was around. At this point in time I would swap out NetBox in favor of Nautobot.
