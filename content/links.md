## My Content on Other Sites

[Using NetBox as a SoT for Ansible + Diving into Ansible Filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyQf5F0gr3w)  
In the video I go over NetBox as your Source of Truth, and walk one through getting started with
using Ansible as that Source of Truth. In the later portion I go through using Ansible Filters to
audit NetBox data to the device data.

[Introduction to Ansible for Network Automation](https://ignition.packetpushers.net/courses/ansible-for-network-automation/)  
This is a course that I created for Packet Pushers Ignition site. It is meant as real world
introduction of Network Automation leveraging Ansilbe. The course takes you through many common
tasks accomplished within Ansible, providing many examples.

## Web Net Development

### Django

This is the my original network development platform. I went with it due to challenges
that Flask presented around getting it to look "Pretty" using Bootstrap. This looked
like the right decision for the time. I would probably recommend Network Engineers using
Flask for web development at this point.  
[Django LDAP Example](https://github.com/etianen/django-python3-ldap)

### Flask

This is a micro-services web setup. It comes very basic and is very easy to get moving.
First recommendation - Flask Mega-Tuturial. It is awesome. Well worth the purchase.

## GNS3 Tips

If looking to connect via Netmiko to GNS3, this may help:

```python
net_connect = ConnectHandler(
    device_type='generic_termserver_telnet',        # changed
    ip='127.0.0.1',
    username='pyclass',
    password='cisco',
    global_delay_factor=4,
    default_enter='\r\n',
    port=5000)
```
