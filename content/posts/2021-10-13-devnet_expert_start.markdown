This week Cisco announced the DevNet Expert certification exam. This exam and certification is something that I have been looking forward to for a long while. Dating back to the announcement of the certifications that were being provided. This was announced at Cisco Live 2019 in San Diego. I had started to lose some hope that this would become a reality with how long of a delay from the initial announcement to the announcement of availability. But it is now here. So here we go.

## DevNet Cert Requirements

For me this is going to be just the lab that is required. I already have the DevNet Professional certification, which has the DevCor exam as a requirement. This exam is the first requirement for the Expert certification. The second part is the lab, which is what the next several months of prep will be for me.

## Helpful Links

So far I have accumulated a few helpful links from the Internet and the various announcements. Here are the links:

* [Lab Topics](https://learningcontent.cisco.com/documents/devnet_expert_exam_topics_2.pdf)
* [Equipment and Software List](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/devnet-expert-equipment-and-software-list)
* [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/)

Let's cover how I plan to use these and how I'm getting started with the studies, right away.

## Lab Topics

This is my blueprint. I'm going to be working through each of these items to make sure that I have an adequate proficiency in this arena. The plan that I have is to make sure that I have the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are going to make for an efficient execution of the lab.

## Equipment and Software List

This is an excellent resource that Cisco is providing. I plan on having a VM built that is going to be emulating each of the pieces of the software on the device. I am anticipating that I will have a machine of similar capabilities, and maybe a UI to it in order to accomplish the practical lab.

### Third Party Software Requirements

The first thing that is standing out to me is that I am already pretty familiar with several of these tools that are listed. I have written about them in my [Open Source Network Management](https://leanpub.com/opensourcenetworkmanagement) book. So I initially feel very good about using these tools:

* Telegraf
* Grafana
* Nginx
* Docker
* Hashicorp Vault

I also use Ansible on a regular occurrence, and same with GitLab. I have some exposure to InfluxDB, and this may be one of the greater learning curves compared to my general experience with Prometheus.

## DevNet Sandbox

The greatest thing that we have as individuals preparing for the exam is that we have a sandbox that provides access to some of the Cisco specific items that will need to be automated/worked on. With that in mind, I'll be using that whenever possible. Hopefully the resources will be available for me as I look to leverage them.

## Summary

Overall I am definitely looking forward to taking a stab at the exam. I may have some other learnings that will come from this. The other aspect as I look at the exam topics is that it is in line with what I work with every day in the day job at Network to Code. This proficiency that is being tested matches up well with my day to day.
