I'm back again with the switch back to Hugo Congo themed blog! Why the switch you ask? Well, I just needed a fresh coat of pain on the blog. I am still very happy writing content with mkdocs-material, but I really just wanted to get back to the theme that is built for a blog. It is purely a preference thing, and I think that this will be a nice clean and smooth change. I had to do a little bit of work to make sure that I get RSS squared away, which I think is in a good state. But overall, I'm going to plan to stick wit this for a little bit.

## Old Theme

Overall I was pretty happy with the Mkdocs-material theme. I could decide to go back to it again, and because of this I'm keeping the set up around for me to make the switch back if I wanted to. But at this point I'm likely sticking to what I have with [Hugo Congo](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/).

## What I Like About Congo

First what I like is that it is built for a blog. The previous world is built for documentation, and I strongly recommend it. I'm liking the cleaniness and the good appearance in the mobile site. When I was looking at my previous blog set up with mkdocs, while very functionaly for a mobile site, it was not as clean as I would like. 

## What I'm Going to Miss

What I'm going to miss the most is the Admonitions and flexibility from writing updates in Python. I probably could have made a go at it with some more mkdocs updates and making a few tweaks here and there. But that just isn't where I'm at with my personal time at this point. I know, there is also the AI side of things that would allow me to get help quicker on what I may want to do. But I'm also getting some of these going within the flexiblity of Hugo and Congo theme.

## The Migration

During the migration I made heavy use of the [Google Antigravity IDE](https://antigravity.google/). With its help to make a few of the conversions, I was able to get a lot of the work done quickly. There were a few places that I needed to make a few edits. But one of the things that I liked about the migration and using the agent mode was to describe what I was looking for visually and it would take care of all of the CSS for me. Now there may be some minor tweaks that would be a little bit better. But for my personal blog, we are good to go.

### What Do I Have Left?

Not a ton. I am going to go back and take a look at the Hugo Admonitions a bit more to see what else I may want there. And I do need to add some images to the page as the cover art. So I have a few minor updates to do there.

## Summary

I'm hoping to be more active and having the look of Hugo Congo I hope will keep me more active, and is also a good method of viewing the content for the readers as well.
