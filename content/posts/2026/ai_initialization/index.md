It's now early 2026 and there is so much happening in AI. That statement is more for myself than anything else in the future, because everyone knows that this is the case. Many are pointing to the [Opus 4.6 Release](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6) and [GPT5.3](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/) as a pivotal point in the AI space, but I would also say the previous generation of the models were spot on to really amplify.


> [!WARNING] OpenClaw Warning
> If you are looking to go out and run this yourself. Please don't jump right into the automated VPS deployment of OpenClaw without thinking and securing it. There are many one-click solutions out there advertising. I do not personally recommend this and in fact would try to persuade you to run on some local hardware that is not one from your company.

## Introduction

We all knew that the AI models would be getting better and better. But when I look back at a year ago when I was thinking about AI and I called the success rate 50/50 and requiring multiple iterations to check and re-check the answers, it still didn't click. I've been paying $20 a month to multiple providers to just keep an eye on things. AI has been around, but it wasn't really transforming me quite yet. I wouldn't use it the way many are using it today.

### Ralph Wiggum Loops

Then a few weeks ago something clicked. First it was the [Ralph Loop](https://ghuntley.com/loop/) that really got me excited. I blew through the credits that I had from Anthropic and OpenAI in no time. I mean, take a look at the spikes in the usage ![Codex Usage Dashboard](image.png). The couple of spikes were new features that I was working on for an app that I thought I would be able to do something with. Except now the paid app that I use anyway has already come out with all of the features. Which is great! One less thing for me to have to ask those around me to use.

This was just the start.

### OpenClaw

For the past couple of weeks I have been using AI to help me out a little bit more at a time. Using Claude Code both in CLI and in the Desktop App, **exploring** what its capabilities are. And I have to say that it is pretty awesome.

Then out of the blue for me, maybe not for others, up pops OpenClaw (Clawdbot -> Moltbot-> OpenClaw). My cousin put out an [article on his blog](https://aaronstuyvenberg.com/posts/clawd-bought-a-car) about using Clawdbot at the time to help him in the car buying experience. It started to click about what the capabilities might be. Then I started to see a few other YouTube personalities were doing. I said, yes, I need to be getting in on this. So I spun up a VM on my home compute and I'm diving head first. The first week, it went well. And I'm looking forward to doing more. And I'm also looking to dive in on local models. I finally have my use case for why I want to use local models, to have a 24/7 available AI system that is not too crazy and not too expensive.

## OpenClaw and Claude Code?

So, should I be looking at OpenClaw or looking at Claude/Claude Code? This is where it may be a surprising answer. I think both. Using AI systems that are directed by human first and foremost makes sense. Having a person in the loop and making sure that things are being done and meet our standards. That is where we are at in the 1Q of 2026 anyway in my mind. It is going to take some time to build out the [SKILLS](#common-areas---skills) that are going to be needed to getting the systems working in tip top shape. Which brings us to SKILLS.

## Common Areas - SKILLS

The one piece that is common across all of the systems that I am seeing is the build out of [AI Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview). These are going to be common place to be able to instruct tools how to be used properly. And it is in plain English that these are written. It is the usage of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle at its finest. The AI Agent systems are there with a lot of capability and previous pattern matching. This just instructs the systems how to use what it has in it's system.

## Summary

I'm still a bit newer compared to some of the others out there that you may seeing content from. But I've had a lot of experiences that I have seen over the years and we are hitting on something here. Don't believe me, take a read of [Matt Shumer](https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/2021256989876109403)'s post about this. It's a terrific read, and I agree that we are at a pivotal point. There will be a lot more exciting and challenging things happening. The best advice I will give is be willing to learn and **explore**. I'm looking forward to where the journey is taking me and there are still really good things to come.
