# Books

For several years I have been providing content in blog posts. This has evolved into writing books as well.

## Open Source Network Management

<img src="/images/open-source-network-management.png" alt="Open Source Network Management Cover" class="float-right ml-4 mb-4 w-1/3 rounded-lg shadow-lg">

I have created a book that is all about getting started with open source tools. [Open Source Network Management](https://leanpub.com/opensourcenetworkmanagement), a book about getting started with using open source tools to manage your network environment. This book guides one along the way of _installing_, _initial configuration_, and basic ways to use the tools. All these are done with installing on a single virtual machine or on an Intel NUC system.

The book is published on [LeanPub](https://www.leanpub.com) that is a place where I can continue to make updates to the book while providing the content to the readers sooners than later. The current state of the book is at a strong technical release state. I am working through having some editing done on the book yet, but no edits of the technical components will be made.

The tools covered in the book thus far:

- [Nautobot](https://www.nautobot.com)
- [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
- [InfluxData Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/)
- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/)

I encourage you to take a look, with the purchase you will be able to get the book in multiple formats including PDF, epub, and mobi formats.

### Amazon Links

I have made the book available now on Amazon Kindle and in the physical form from Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing. Which the book will be printed on demand in a physical format! Check out Amazon for these options - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Source-Network-Management-network-ebook/dp/B0BQFL7WJD/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=open+source+network+management&qid=1682789845&sprefix=Open+Source+Network%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-1)

## Network Automation with Nautobot

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81tjWDoYk3L._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Nautobot Book Cover" class="float-right ml-4 mb-4 w-1/3 rounded-lg shadow-lg">

I'm proud to have been an author in the [Network Automation with Nautobot found on Amazon](https://a.co/d/7JPvYpC) book that has recently been released. The book covers:

* Learn how documenting your network in Nautobot can accelerate your network automation journey
* Apply NetDevOps to your network by leveraging Nautobot as a network source of truth
* Minimize tool sprawl by extending, using, or building Nautobot Apps

> Nautobot enables network teams to build a scalable and extensible network source of truth that provides a foundation to power any network automation stack.

With the help of this guide, you'll learn how to deploy, manage, and integrate Nautobot as a source of truth and network automation platform. As you progress, you'll learn what a network source of truth is, the relationship between data and network automation, and network data models. You'll also gain a broad understanding of Nautobot and its robust features that allow maximum flexibility. A dedicated section will show you how to construct a single source of truth with Nautobot and help you explore its programmatic APIs, including REST APIs, GraphQL, webhooks, and Nautobot Job Hooks. Later, you'll develop custom data models and custom apps for Nautobot and experience its extensibility and powerful developer API. In the last part of this book, you'll discover how to deploy configuration compliance and automated remediation once Nautobot is deployed as a network source of truth.

By the end of this book, you'll be able to design and manage Nautobot as a network source of truth, understand its key features, and extend Nautobot by creating custom data models and apps that suit your network and your team.

## Modern Network Observability

The second book in 2024 is Modern Network Observability, which provides a hands-on approach to using open source tools for network observability in 2024. _(More details coming soon)_
